# TechInverted CMS Website

This is the repository for TechInverted's official website. We're building it completely in public.


This site showcases lots of cool stuff like GraphQL API, a super dynamic light / dark mode into a Next site without any first-load flickering, how to render remotely stored docs from MDX to NextJS pages, and much more.  

## Tech stack:

- Payload 
- TypeScript
- Next 13 and its new `/app` folder
- SCSS Modules
- GraphQL
- MDX for docs

#### The CMS

The TechInverted CMS is leveraged for everything that the site does, outside of its documentation which is all stored as Markdown in the  repo itself.
